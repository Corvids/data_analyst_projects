So, these metrics should be _independent_ of our experiment.  Conversely, our **evaluation metrics** are metrics which should change as a direct result from our experiment; therefore, these metrics are _dependent_ upon our experiment.\n",

    "The rationale I had for choosing or not choosing each metric is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of cookies:** I chose this as an invariant metric because the number of unique cookies occurs before each visitor sees the experiment so this metric is independent from the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of user-ids:** I didn't choose this metric as either an invariant metric or an evaluation metric because the number of users who enroll in the free trial is dependent on the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of clicks:** This is a good invariant metric because the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start Free Trial\" button is independent from the free trial screener (i.e. the click happens before the user sees the experimet).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Click-through-probability:** This is a good invariant metric because the user clicks before the experiment happens, so the click is independent from the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gross conversion:** I chose this as an evaluation metric because the gross conversion is directly dependent on the results of the experiment.  The number of user-ids divided by the number of unique cookies should theoretically increase as a result of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retention:** I chose this as an evaluation metric because it is dependent on the experiment since those users who are asked to honestly asses their own time commitment (as is able to commit to that time) for the nanodegree are more likely to enroll past the trial period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Net conversion:** I chose this as an evaluation metric because it is dependent on the effect of the experiment; the number of user-ids divided by the number of unique cookies to click on the \"Start Free Trial\" button should increase with the addition of the self-evaluation."
